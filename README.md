# OSRS-AHK
A collection of simple, well-commented AutoHotkey (AHK) scripts for Old School RuneScape, created as a learning resource. Focused on core automation concepts like mouse input, timing, and logic. Educational use only. Licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.

There are individual README.md files in the git. 
Please refer to them, if they don't make sense and you cant quite work it out. feel free to reach out to me. (if you can find me)

Don't be a shit cunt and sell these, don't be a loser and PK with the resources, and most of all. Enjoy the long-lasting account due to randomisation of clicks. My main has been around for a very very long time and never been hit using these.
