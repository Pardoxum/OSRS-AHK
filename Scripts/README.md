Here is a random compilation of examples used to help develop my final versions.

Mind you; all co-ordinates used here have been inputted manually based on my monitor setup. It no-longer works with my current setup and probably wont with yours either. so make sure to look at /Tools/ and get started on re-building these scripts for personal use.

fletch.ahk - Completely random intervals, random clicking patterns on the items and hotkeyed.
osrs.ahk - One of my first prayer swap scripts, also contains some basic hotkeys that are useful.
OSRS_S50_V1.4.AHK - the almost complete script (designed for Stretched Mode [50] in runelite.
OSRS_S100_V1.4.AHK - the almost complete script (designed for Stretched Mode [100] in runelite.
OSRS_S100_V2.5-img.AHK - Same as above, although also has functionality of Image Search
