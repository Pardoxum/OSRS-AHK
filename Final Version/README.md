Pretty much these are more or less final versions of the scripts I have ran for a while.
NOGEARSWAPS = No Imagesearch Function
GEARSWAPS = Imagesearch Function

Colours.txt = The colours i have used in item tags runelite to highlight my gear according to setups.
I also converted these colours to a png because using coloursearch function in AHK was doing my head in, where as a single pixel Imagesearch was much faster and accurate.

It was my goal to originally make the boxes.ahk setup automated with a GUI, So pretty much a new user with different monitors/setup could come in, hit say F5~
and then click the top left and bottom right of their inventory having the script automatically making 28 boundaries and filling that in to the script where required. 

Maybe in the future I will start to play around with this but for now. this will just be a release of my knowledge/experiments for you to have available.
